# Unsupervised Learning Crash Course
_Crash Course on Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Techniques._

In this two-hours long tutorial we will go explore two of the main approaches of Unsupervised Learning, namely _Clustering_ and _Dimension Reduction_. 

Here is the general outline of the course: 

1. Preamble on different (Machine) _Learning Flavours_
	- Quick recap of `sklearn` APIs, with particular emphasis on Clustering

2. Introduction to Clustering
	- Clustering Approaches: Flat vs Hierarchical vs Spectral algorithms
	- Hands-on using `KMeans` clustering w/ limitations
	- Introduction to `HDBscan` and how it works
	- (**EXTRA**) Hands-on Example of Semi-Supervised Learning


3. Dimension Reduction: from `PCA` to `UMAP`
	- UMAP features and Inverse Transformation Example 	


## Instructions

### Get the material

Clone the current repository, in order to get the course materials. To do so, once connected to your remote machine (via `SSH`), execute the following instructions:

```bash
cd $HOME  #¬†This will make sure you'll be in your HOME folder
git clone https://github.com/WebValley2021ReImagined/unsupervised-learning.git
```

**Note**: This will create a new folder named `unsupervised-learning`. Move into this folder by typing:

```bash
cd unsupervised-learning
```

Well done! Now you should do be in the right location. Bear with me another few seconds, following instructions reported below üôè

### Updating your Environment

To execute the notebooks in this repository, a few _extra_ packages are required, but installing them in your Conda environment is super easy. 

While into the `unsupervised-learning` folder, execute the two following instructions:

```bash
conda activate py38_default  #activate your conda environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # to install the extra packages
```

üéâ You should be now ready to go!

The last bit is to run your `jupyter lab` server, and open the notebooks:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
